## ⚠️ REMAINING CONFIGURATION (10%)

### **1. Environment Variables**

Add to `.env`:

```env
# Email Configuration (SMTP)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-specific-password

# GHL Pipeline IDs
GHL_REAL_ESTATE_BROKER_PIPELINE_ID=your_pipeline_id
GHL_INVESTMENT_PIPELINE_ID=your_pipeline_id

# JR's GHL Calendar ID
GHL_JR_CALENDAR_ID=your_calendar_id
```

**How to get these:**
- **SMTP Password:** Google Account → App Passwords (2FA required)
- **GHL Pipeline IDs:** GHL admin → Pipelines
- **Calendar ID:** GHL admin → Settings → Calendars → Find JR's calendar

### **2. Update Pre-Qual Form**

The `/apply` page needs to capture service type and redirect:

```typescript
const handlePreQualSubmit = async (data) => {
  // Submit to GHL
  const appId = await submitPreQual(data);
  
  // Redirect based on service type
  if (data.serviceType === 'Business Loans') {
    navigate(`/full-lending-application-1?appId=${appId}`);
  } else if (data.serviceType === 'Real Estate Broker') {
    navigate(`/real-estate-application?appId=${appId}`);
  } else if (data.serviceType === 'Investment') {
    navigate(`/investment-application?appId=${appId}`);
  } else if (data.serviceType === 'Real Estate Finance') {
    navigate(`/full-lending-application-1?appId=${appId}`);
  }
};
```

### **3. Update Header Navigation**

In `client/src/components/layout/global-header.tsx`, update links (around lines 165-175):

```typescript
<Link href="/apply?service=business-loans">Business Loans</Link>
<Link href="/apply?service=real-estate">Real Estate</Link>
<Link href="/apply?service=investments">Investments</Link>
```

Or:
- Business Loans → `/apply?service=business-loans`
- Real Estate → `/apply?service=real-estate` 
- Investments → `/apply?service=investments`

### **4. Check Checkbox Component**

Verify `client/src/components/ui/checkbox.tsx` exists. If not, run:
```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add checkbox
```

### **5. Install nodemailer (if not installed)**

```bash
npm install nodemailer
npm install @types/nodemailer --save-dev
```

# Saint Vision Group - AI Brokerage Platform

## Overview
This project is a fully automated AI brokerage platform that combines the CookinKnowledge-101-SaintSal AI backbone with Saint Vision Group's brokerage services (Real Estate, Business Lending, and Investment Suite). The platform leverages SaintSalâ„¢ HACPâ„¢ technology (U.S. Patent No. 10,290,222), Azure Cognitive Services, PostgreSQL, GoHighLevel (GHL) CRM, and a custom knowledge base to provide real-time chat, voice processing, brain ingestion, tone detection, brokerage service pages, and automated lead capture. Its core purpose is to streamline and automate the brokerage process through advanced AI integration.

## Business Model (WHITE-LABEL OPERATION)

**SAINT VISION GROUP = THE BROKERAGE (Client-Facing A-Z Service):**
- âœ… Application & Document Collection
- âœ… Credit Pull & Financial Analysis
- âœ… Complete Underwriting (In-House)
- âœ… Loan Approval & Structuring
- âœ… Conditions & Compliance
- âœ… Closing Documents & Final Processing
- âœ… Client owns the relationship with Saint Vision Group ONLY

**FUNDING PARTNERS = CAPITAL PROVIDERS ONLY (Backend/Internal):**
- ðŸ’° Provide capital at the end (after SVG approval)
- ðŸ’° Receive clean, approved packages from SVG
- ðŸ’° Wire funds based on SVG's underwriting
- ðŸ’° Generally white-labeled (client doesn't see them)
- ðŸ’° Strategic shout-outs only when it adds credibility

**KEY PRINCIPLE:** Client sees "Saint Vision Group - Powered by SaintBrokerâ„¢ AI" throughout entire journey. Partners are SVG's competitive advantage and backend relationships - NOT exposed to clients except in strategic cases.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend
The client uses Vite with React and TypeScript, styled with shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS. It's a single-page application using Wouter for routing and TanStack Query for server state. Key components include layouts, chat interfaces, dashboards, AI assistant feedback, and brokerage service pages with integrated GHL lead capture forms.

### Backend
The server is built with Express.js and TypeScript, following a RESTful API design. It features a storage layer (in-memory for easy migration), a service layer for AI, CRM, and brain ingestion, a Godmode executor for administrative tasks, and a route layer for API management. It integrates with Vite for development and serves static files in production.

### Data Storage
PostgreSQL is used for data persistence with Drizzle ORM, supporting full schema management for users, conversations, knowledge base, logging, and activity tracking. It includes automatic migrations and environment-configured connection pooling.

### Authentication and Authorization
The system uses session-based authentication with tiered user access (free, pro, enterprise) managed via Stripe subscriptions (though Stripe payment processing is currently removed). Feature gating controls access to advanced functionalities like Godmode and unlimited knowledge base storage.

### AI Integration
SaintSalâ„¢ HACPâ„¢ technology (U.S. Patent No. 10,290,222) and Azure Cognitive Services provide core AI functionalities, including conversation management with context preservation, tone analysis, real-time voice processing (speech-to-text, text-to-speech), knowledge base content ingestion with embeddings, and response generation. The system incorporates fallback mechanisms for AI service interruptions.

### UI/UX Decisions
The platform features unified Saint Vision Group branding, real-time chat interfaces, dedicated brokerage service pages, and ROI calculators for lending and investments. It incorporates a floating SaintBroker AI assistant with an enhanced knowledge base. Navigation includes prominent "Apply Now - Pre-Qualify" buttons.

### System Design Choices
The architecture emphasizes modularity with distinct service layers. It integrates GHL for all lead capture and workflow automation, featuring an 11-stage lending pipeline with full AI agent access and real-time tracking. Security and compliance adhere to GLBA, TCPA, and SOC 2 Type II standards, with data encryption and soft credit inquiries.

## üìä ROI CALCULATORS - EXACT FORMULAS

### **1. Mortgage/Loan Payment Calculator**
**Purpose**: Calculate monthly mortgage payments accurately

**Formula**:
```javascript
function calculateMortgage(loanAmount, loanTermYears, annualInterestRate) {
  // Convert annual rate to monthly rate (as decimal)
  const monthlyRate = (annualInterestRate / 100) / 12;
  
  // Total number of payments
  const numberOfPayments = loanTermYears * 12;
  
  // Calculate compound factor
  const compoundFactor = Math.pow(1 + monthlyRate, numberOfPayments);
  
  // Monthly payment formula
  const monthlyPayment = (loanAmount * monthlyRate * compoundFactor) / (compoundFactor - 1);
  
  return monthlyPayment;
}
```

**Validation**:
- Must check: `!isNaN(monthlyPayment) && monthlyPayment !== Infinity && monthlyPayment !== -Infinity && monthlyPayment > 0`
- Display: `$${monthlyPayment.toFixed(2)}`

**Example**:
- Loan Amount: $500,000

  const monthlyReturn = annualReturn / 12;
  
  // Total return over term
  const totalReturn = annualReturn * termYears;
  
  // Final value
  const finalValue = principal + totalReturn;
  
  return {
    annualReturn,

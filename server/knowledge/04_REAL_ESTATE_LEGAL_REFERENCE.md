# PART 1: REAL ESTATE MASTERY

## 1. COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TYPES & ANALYSIS

### A. MULTIFAMILY (APARTMENTS)

**Property Classes:**
```
Class A:
- New construction or recently renovated (<10 years)
- Premium locations (urban cores, top suburbs)
- High-end finishes, amenities (pool, gym, concierge)
- Institutional-quality
- Rent: Top 20% of market
- Cap rates: 4-6%
- Tenants: Young professionals, high-income

Class B:
- 10-25 years old, well-maintained
- Good locations (secondary neighborhoods)
- Standard amenities
- Core market
- Rent: Middle 60% of market
- Cap rates: 5.5-7%
- Tenants: Middle-class, families

- 25+ years old
- Working-class neighborhoods
- Minimal amenities
- Deferred maintenance common
- Rent: Bottom 20% of market
- Cap rates: 7-10%+
- Tenants: Blue-collar, fixed income
- Value-add opportunity
```

**Investment Analysis:**

**Underwriting Example:**
```
100-unit Class B apartment building

INCOME:
100 units × $1,500/month × 12 months = $1,800,000 gross rent
Other income (parking, laundry, pet fees): $50,000
Gross Potential Income: $1,850,000

Less: Vacancy (5%): -$92,500
Effective Gross Income (EGI): $1,757,500

EXPENSES (Operating):
Property taxes: $120,000 (varies by jurisdiction)
Insurance: $30,000
Property management (5% EGI): $87,875
Utilities (common areas): $40,000
Repairs & maintenance: $60,000 (escalates with age)
Landscaping: $15,000
Payroll (leasing, maintenance staff): $150,000
Administrative: $25,000
Reserves for replacement (CapEx): $50,000 ($500/unit)
Total Operating Expenses: $577,875

NOI (Net Operating Income):
EGI - Expenses = $1,757,500 - $577,875 = $1,179,625

VALUATION:
Assuming 6.5% cap rate
Value = NOI / Cap Rate = $1,179,625 / 0.065 = $18,148,077

Rounded: $18M purchase price

RETURNS ANALYSIS:
Assuming 70% LTV financing at 6% interest

Equity: $5.4M (30%)
Debt: $12.6M (70%)

Annual Debt Service:
$12.6M @ 6% amortizing over 30 years = $907,474

Cash Flow:
NOI: $1,179,625
Less Debt Service: -$907,474
Cash Flow Before Tax: $272,151

Cash-on-Cash Return: $272,151 / $5,400,000 = 5.0%

Year 1 IRR Components:
- Cash flow: 5.0%
- Principal paydown: ~1.5% (first year, mostly interest)
- Appreciation (assume 3%): 3.0%
- Total unlevered return: ~9.5%
- Leveraged equity IRR: ~15-18% (with appreciation + rent growth)
```

**Value-Add Strategies:**
```
1. RENOVATIONS (Rent Premium)
   - Unit upgrades: $10-15K/unit (kitchens, baths, flooring)
   - Rent increase: $100-200/month
   - Payback: 5-7 years
   - Cap rate compression: 50-100 bps (property improves class)

2. OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS
   - Reduce expenses (energy efficiency, renegotiate contracts)
   - Increase ancillary income (laundry, parking, storage, pet fees)
   - Reduce vacancy (professional management, marketing)

3. REPOSITION TO HIGHER CLASS
   - Full property renovation
   - Rebrand and re-lease
   - Tenant mix improvement
   - Cap rate: 7.5% → 6.0% (value increase even without NOI growth)
```

### B. OFFICE BUILDINGS

**Office Classifications:**
```
Class A:
- Premium CBD locations or top suburban nodes
- High-quality construction
- Modern systems (HVAC, elevators, security)
- Efficient floor plates (25,000+ SF)
- Institutional tenants
- Rent: $35-75/SF (varies by market)

Class B:
- Good locations but not prime
- Older buildings (20-40 years) but functional
- Mix of local/regional tenants
- Rent: $20-35/SF

Class C:
- Older (40+ years), functional obsolescence
- Deferred maintenance
- Small local tenants
- Rent: $15-25/SF
- Redevelopment/conversion opportunity
```

**Lease Structures:**

**Full-Service Gross (FSG):**
```
Tenant pays: One rate (e.g., $35/SF)
Landlord pays: All operating expenses, taxes, insurance

Example:
10,000 SF lease @ $35/SF = $350,000/year
Landlord pays: $15/SF expenses = $150,000
Landlord net: $20/SF = $200,000

Used in: Class A CBD office
```

**Modified Gross / Base Year:**
```
Base year expenses established (e.g., $15/SF)
Tenant pays: Base rent + share of expense increases above base year

Example:
Year 1: Expenses $15/SF (base year)
Year 2: Expenses $16/SF
Tenant pays: Base rent + $1/SF additional

Protects tenant from dramatic expense increases
Protects landlord from expense inflation
```

**Triple Net (NNN):**
```
Tenant pays: Base rent + all expenses (taxes, insurance, CAM)

Example:
Base rent: $25/SF
CAM (common area maintenance): $5/SF
Taxes: $4/SF
Insurance: $1/SF
Total: $35/SF

Tenant responsible for all increases
Landlord has predictable net income

Used in: Single-tenant buildings, retail
```

**Office Market Challenges (Post-COVID):**
```
Work-from-home impact:
- Reduced space needs (50-70% office attendance)
- Flight to quality (companies consolidate into Class A)
- Suburban resurgence (closer to employees)

Obsolescence:
- Class B/C struggling (high vacancy)
- Adaptive reuse (office → residential conversion)
- Value destruction (peak $500/SF → now $200/SF)

Underwriting conservatism:
- Stress test remote work scenarios
- Shorter lease terms (tenant flexibility)
- Free rent concessions (6-12 months on 5-year lease)
- Higher cap rates (risk premium)
```

---

### C. RETAIL PROPERTIES

**Retail Categories:**

**Anchored Shopping Centers:**
```
Power Center:
- Big-box anchors (Target, Best Buy, Home Depot)
- 250,000-750,000 SF
- Freestanding stores with shared parking
- Anchors: 15-30% of GLA (gross leasable area)
- Anchors pay low rent ($5-10/SF) but drive traffic
- Inline tenants pay higher rent ($20-40/SF)

Strip Center:
- Grocery anchor (Kroger, Safeway, local chain)
- 30,000-150,000 SF
- Linear configuration
- Grocery: ~50% of GLA
- Services (dry cleaner, hair salon) and restaurants
- Necessity-based (recession-resistant)

Regional Mall:
- Department store anchors (2-4 anchors)
- 400,000-2M SF
- Enclosed, climate-controlled
- Department stores own their boxes (don't pay rent)
- Inline tenants pay high rent ($50-150/SF in prime malls)
- Struggling format (online competition, anchor closures)
```

**Unanchored / Lifestyle:**
```
Lifestyle Center:
- Open-air
- Upscale tenants (Apple, lululemon, restaurants)
- Experience-focused
- Smaller GLA (150,000-500,000 SF)

Urban Retail:
- Street-level storefronts
- High foot traffic locations
- Mixed-use (retail below, office/residential above)
- Highest rents (can exceed $200/SF in Manhattan, SF)
```

**Retail Lease Terms:**

**Percentage Rent:**
```
Structure: Base rent + % of sales over breakpoint

Example:
Base rent: $50,000/year
Percentage: 7% of gross sales
Natural breakpoint: $50,000 / 0.07 = $714,286
If sales > $714,286 → percentage rent kicks in

Sales $1,000,000:
Base: $50,000
Percentage: 7% × ($1,000,000 - $714,286) = $20,000
Total rent: $70,000

Used in: Malls, high-traffic retail
Aligns landlord-tenant interests (both benefit from sales)
```

**Co-Tenancy Clauses:**
```
Trigger: If anchor vacates or occupancy falls below threshold, tenant can:
- Reduce rent (e.g., to % rent only)
- Terminate lease
- Go dark (close store but continue paying)

Example:
"If anchor store vacates, tenant's base rent reduced by 50%"

Risk to landlord: Loss of multiple tenants if anchor leaves
Mitigation: Backfill anchor quickly, negotiate limits on co-tenancy
```

**CAM (Common Area Maintenance) Reconciliation:**
```
Annual reconciliation of actual vs. estimated CAM

Estimated CAM: $5/SF (tenant pays monthly)
Actual CAM: $5.50/SF
Tenant owes: $0.50/SF additional (true-up)

Controllable vs. Uncontrollable:
- Controllable: Landscaping, janitorial (landlord can manage)
- Uncontrollable: Snow removal, taxes (pass-through)

Caps: Tenants negotiate caps on controllable expenses (e.g., 3% annual increase)
```

### D. INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES

**Industrial Types:**

**Warehouse / Distribution:**
```
Characteristics:
- High ceilings (28-40 feet clear height)

Tenants:
- Food distributors
- Pharmaceutical storage
- Third-party cold chain logistics

Rent: $15-25/SF (high due to specialized infrastructure)
Development cost: 2-3× conventional warehouse
Barriers to entry: High (favors existing operators)
```

**Last-Mile Logistics:**
```
Definition: Final leg of delivery to consumer

Characteristics:
- Urban/suburban infill locations

Tenants:
- Amazon, FedEx, UPS
- Local delivery services
- Meal kit/grocery delivery

Rent premium: 20-40% above conventional warehouse (location value)

Competition: Conversion of retail/office to industrial
```

**Industrial Market Dynamics:**

**Supply Constraints:**
```
Land scarcity:
- Industrial land rezoned to higher-value uses (residential, retail)
- NIMBYism (neighbors oppose industrial development)
- Environmental concerns (traffic, noise, air quality)

Result: Supply growth <2% annually (demand 4-6%)
Rent growth: 5-8% annually (2015-2022)
Cap rate compression: 8% → 5% (institutional interest)
```

**E-commerce Tailwinds:**
```
E-commerce penetration: 10% → 22% (2015-2024)
For every $1B online sales: Need 1.25M SF warehouse space

Amazon effect:
- 400M+ SF warehouse space (largest private real estate user)
- Competitive pressure → Other retailers need logistics infrastructure
- Leases signed before profitability (land grab strategy)

Concern: What if e-commerce growth slows or Amazon retrenches?
- Some markets overbuilt (Inland Empire, Phoenix)
- Lease expirations 2025-2027 (5-7 year terms from 2018-2022 boom)

## 1. DEFENSE STRATEGY & MILITARY OPERATIONS

### A. JOINT MILITARY DOCTRINE

**Levels of War:**
```
STRATEGIC LEVEL:
- National security objectives
- Theater/campaign planning
- Resource allocation
- Policy integration

Example: Decision to intervene in a conflict region, force structure, budget priorities

OPERATIONAL LEVEL:
- Campaign design
- Phasing operations
- Operational reach
- Sustainment

Example: Planning multi-phase operation to degrade enemy air defenses, then establish air superiority, then ground offensive

TACTICAL LEVEL:
- Battles and engagements
- Maneuver and fires integration
- Mission execution

Example: Infantry battalion conducts raid on enemy position
```

**Principles of War:**
```
1. OBJECTIVE: Direct operations toward clearly defined, decisive objective
2. OFFENSIVE: Seize, retain, exploit initiative
3. MASS: Concentrate combat power at decisive place/time
4. ECONOMY OF FORCE: Allocate minimum essential combat power to secondary efforts
5. MANEUVER: Place enemy in position of disadvantage
6. UNITY OF COMMAND: Single commander with requisite authority
7. SECURITY: Never permit enemy to acquire unexpected advantage
8. SURPRISE: Strike enemy at time/place/manner for which unprepared
9. SIMPLICITY: Prepare clear, uncomplicated plans/orders
```

---

### B. CONTRACT TYPES (FAR Part 16)

**Fixed-Price Contracts:**

**Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP):**
```
Contract Value: $10,000,000 (fixed)

Characteristics:
- Price does not change regardless of costs
- Maximum risk to contractor, minimum to government
- Best when: Requirements are well-defined, risk is low

Example:
Government buys 100 trucks at $100K each = $10M
If trucks cost contractor $90K each: Profit $1M
If trucks cost contractor $110K each: Loss $1M

Appropriate for:
- Commercial items
- Mature technology
- Stable requirements
- Competitive environment
```

**Fixed-Price Incentive (FPI):**
```
Target Cost: $10M
Target Profit: $1M
Target Price: $11M
Ceiling Price: $12M
Share Ratio: 80/20 (Gov/Contractor)

If actual cost is $9M (under target by $1M):
Contractor gets: $1M profit + ($1M × 20%) = $1.2M profit
Government pays: $9M + $1.2M = $10.2M (saves $800K)

If actual cost is $11M (over target by $1M):
Contractor gets: $1M profit - ($1M × 20%) = $800K profit
Government pays: $11M + $800K = $11.8M (pays $800K more)

Incentivizes cost control but shares risk
```

**Cost-Reimbursement Contracts:**

**Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF):**
```
Estimated Cost: $10M
Fixed Fee: $1M

Actual cost $9M: Government pays $9M + $1M = $10M
Actual cost $11M: Government pays $11M + $1M = $12M

Fee does not change based on cost
Used when: Uncertain requirements, R&D, high risk
```

**Cost-Plus-Incentive-Fee (CPIF):**
```
Target Cost: $10M
Target Fee: $1M
Minimum Fee: $500K
Maximum Fee: $1.5M
Share Ratio: 80/20

Similar to FPI but with cost-reimbursement base
```

**Cost-Plus-Award-Fee (CPAF):**
```
Base Fee: $200K (guaranteed)
Award Fee Pool: $800K (at risk)

Award Fee Determination:
Government evaluates performance (subjective):
- Excellent: 100% of award fee ($800K) → Total fee $1M
- Unsatisfactory: 0% of award fee → Total fee $200K

Period evaluations (quarterly/semi-annual)
Roll-over provisions (can earn unearned fees later)
```

- Low performance risk
- Price is dominant factor
```

**Best Value Trade-off:**
```
Typical factors:
1. Technical approach (30-40%)
2. Past performance (20-30%)
3. Management approach (15-20%)
4. Price/cost (20-30%)

Adjectival ratings:
- Outstanding/Exceptional
